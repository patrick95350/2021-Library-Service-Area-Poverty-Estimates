# 2021-Library-Service-Area-Poverty-Estimates

2021 Local Library Investment Grants program requires CSL to prioritize libraries in higher-poverty areas. Goal of this project is to use US Census American Community Survey poverty data at the tract level along with an adjustment for cost of living using the California Poverty Measure (PPIC 2020?) to calculate the level of poverty in each library service area.
